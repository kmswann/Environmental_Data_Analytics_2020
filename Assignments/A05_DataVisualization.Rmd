## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on Data Visualization 

## Directions
1. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
6. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
8. After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the dropbox in Sakai. Add your last name into the file name (e.g., "Salk_A05_DataVisualization.Rmd") prior to submission.

The completed exercise is due on Tuesday, February 11 at 1:00 pm.



## Set up your session 
1. Set up your session. Verify your working directory and load the tidyverse and cowplot packages. Upload the NTL-LTER processed data files for nutrients and chemistry/physics for Peter and Paul Lakes (tidy and gathered) and the processed data file for the Niwot Ridge litter dataset. 

2. Make sure R is reading dates as date format; if not change the format to date.
```{r "setup", include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'C:/Users/krist/Box Sync/Spring 2020/R/Environmental_Data_Analytics_2020')
getwd()
```

```{r}
#1

PeterPaul.chem.nutrients <- 
  read.csv("./Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Lake_Chemistry_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv")
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered <-
  read.csv("./Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_PeterPaulGathered_Processed.csv")
litter <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/NEON_NIWO_Litter_mass_trap_Processed.csv")

#2
class(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered$sampledate)
class(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate)
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate <- as.Date(
  PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered$sampledate <- as.Date(
  PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered$sampledate, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
class(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered$sampledate)
class(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate)



```
## Define your theme
3. Build a theme and set it as your default theme.

```{r}
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top") 

```

## Create graphs
For numbers 4-7, create ggplot graphs and adjust aesthetics to follow best practices for data visualization. Ensure your theme, color palettes, axes, and additional aesthetics are edited accordingly.

4. [NTL-LTER] Plot total phosphorus by phosphate, with separate aesthetics for Peter and Paul lakes. Add a line of best fit and color it black. Adjust your axes to hide extreme values.

```{r}



```


5. [NTL-LTER] Make three separate boxplots of (a) temperature, (b) TP, and (c) TN, with month as the x axis and lake as a color aesthetic. Then, create a cowplot that combines the three graphs. Make sure that only one legend is present and that graph axes are aligned.

```{r}


```

Question: What do you observe about the variables of interest over seasons and between lakes? 

> Answer: 

6. [Niwot Ridge] Plot a subset of the litter dataset by displaying only the "Needles" functional group. Plot the dry mass of needle litter by date and separate by NLCD class with a color aesthetic. (no need to adjust the name of each land use)

7. [Niwot Ridge] Now, plot the same plot but with NLCD classes separated into three facets rather than separated by color. 

```{r}



```

Question: Which of these plots (6 vs. 7) do you think is more effective, and why?
