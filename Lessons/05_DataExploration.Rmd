## Objectives
1. Import and explore datasets in R
2. Graphically explore datasets in R
3. Apply data exploration skills to a real-world example dataset

## Opening discussion: why do we explore our data?

Why is data exploration our first step in analyzing a dataset? What information do we gain? How does data exploration aid in our decision-making for data analysis steps further down the pipeline?

Check to see if you need to transform; look at ranges; what questions can actually be answered; Might not be relevant. 

## Import data and view summaries

```{r, message = FALSE}
# 1. Set up your working directory
getwd()

# 2. Load packges
library(tidyverse)

# 3. Import datasets
USGS.flow.data <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/USGS_Site02085000_Flow_Processed.csv")

#view allows you to open the file, but doesn't work well with knit so #'ed. 
#View(USGS.flow.data)
# Alternate option: click on data frame in Environment tab

colnames(USGS.flow.data)
str(USGS.flow.data)
dim(USGS.flow.data)

# Check our date column
class(USGS.flow.data$datetime)

USGS.flow.data$datetime <- as.Date(USGS.flow.data$datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%d") 
class(USGS.flow.data$datetime)
#as.Date changes the format from factor to date

```


## Visualization for Data Exploration

Although the `summary()` function is helpful in getting an idea of the spread of values in a numeric dataset, it can be useful to create visual representations of the data to help form hypotheses and direct downstream data analysis. Below is a summary of the useful types of graphs for data exploration.

Note: each of these approaches utilize the package "ggplot2". We will be covering the syntax of ggplot in a later lesson, but for now you should familiarize yourself with the functionality of what each command is doing.

### Bar Chart (function: geom_bar)

Visualize count data for categorical variables. 

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(USGS.flow.data, aes(x = discharge.mean.approval)) +
  geom_bar()
#aes aesthetics 
#geom_bar makes bar chart, automatically does count

```


### Histogram (function: geom_histogram)

Visualize distributions of values for continuous numerical variables. What is happening in each line of code? Insert a comment above each line.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = discharge.mean))
#note that aes is done in a subcategory below ggplot here. 
#note the + means continue to read the rest of the line

#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = discharge.mean), binwidth = 10)
#binwidth, more bins based on the scale rather than setting bin #

#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = discharge.mean), bins = 20)
#more bins

#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data, aes(x = discharge.mean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 500))
# binwidth and sets the x-axis to 500 cfs to get rid of negative space. 

#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = gage.height.mean))
#gage height!! 

#you can name this histogram with the <- function, but you'll need to then use the print(name) 

```
### Frequency line graph (function: geom_freqpoly)

An alternate to a histogram is a frequency polygon graph (distributions of values for continuous numerical variables). Instead of displaying bars,  counts of continuous variables are displayed as lines. This is advantageous if you want to display multiple variables or categories of variables at once.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = gage.height.mean), bins = 50) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = gage.height.min), bins = 50, color = "cyan") +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = gage.height.max), bins = 50,  lty = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10))
#note the color set and the lty set (2 is dashed) and adjust x-axis
#note that data is removed...

length(USGS.flow.data$gage.height.max)
length(USGS.flow.data$gage.height.min)
length(USGS.flow.data$gage.height.mean)

#all the same, but you look at summary to see the NAs, to see different sample counts
summary(USGS.flow.data$gage.height.max)
summary(USGS.flow.data$gage.height.min)
summary(USGS.flow.data$gage.height.mean)

#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = gage.height.mean, color = gage.height.mean.approval), bins = 50) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
#note how this is representative of the bar charts done showing A and P...
#note the legend!
#default colors given, don't use the defaults bc it looks lazy! 

```
### Box-and-whisker plots (function: geom_boxplot, geom_violin)

A box-and-whisker plot is yet another alternative to histograms (distributions of values for continuous numerical variables). These plots consist of: 

* A box from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the data, called the interquartile range (IQR).

* A bold line inside the box representing the median value of the data. Whether the median is in the center or off to one side of the IQR will give you an idea about the skewness of your data.

* A line outside of the box representing values falling within 1.5 times the IQR. 

* Points representing outliers, values that fall outside 1.5 times the IQR. 

An alternate option is a violin plot, which displays density distributions, somewhat like a hybrid of the box-and-whiskers and the frequency polygon plot.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = gage.height.mean.approval, y = gage.height.mean))

#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = gage.height.mean, y = discharge.mean, group = cut_width(gage.height.mean, 1)))
#continuous data in boxplot form...??

#
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = gage.height.mean.approval, y = gage.height.mean), 
              draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
#violin plot with %iles 
#add scale = "count" will change the violin width to the # of counts
#the default is scale = "area" shows equal area between the two even though the count is totally different. 

```

### Scatterplot (function: geom_point)
Visualize relationships between continuous numerical variables.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = discharge.mean, y = gage.height.mean))
#gage mean  vs discharge mean will help you come up with an equation for discharge... 


ggplot(USGS.flow.data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = datetime, y = discharge.mean))
# discharge by years. 
```

Question: under what circumstances would it be beneficial to use each of these graph types (bar plot, histogram, frequency polygon, box-and whisker, violin, scatterplot)?
